 ### Yahtzee is a popular dice game that is played with five standard six-sided dice. The game consists of a series of rounds, and each round involves rolling the dice up to three times in an attempt to get certain combinations of dice faces.

## Basic rules of Yahtzee:

 - At the beginning of each round, the player rolls all five dice.
 - After the first roll, the player can choose to keep any number of dice and re-roll the rest. The player can do this up to two more times.
 - Once the player has finished rolling the dice, they must choose a category to score. There are 13 categories, each with different requirements:
    - Ones: Score the total of all dice showing the number 1.
